Fity3
-----

Fity3 is a Twitter snowflake like scheme generator that fits in 53 bits.

       :target: https://travis-ci.org/cablehead/python-fity3

Its scheme is::

    timestamp | worker_id | sequence
     41 bits  |  4 bits   |  8 bits

`Twitter's snowflake scheme
<https://blog.twitter.com/2010/announcing-snowflake>`_ for id generation has a
bunch of nice properties. An enormous number of roughly-sorted ids can be
created per second in an uncoordinated manner.

However it's *painful* working with 64 bit integers in environments that use
IEEE 754 floating points for numerics. Particular `JavaScript
<https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/twitter-ids-json-and-snowflake>`_ and the
`scores for Redis sorted sets
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20295544/redis-sorted-set-wrong-score>`_.

This scheme allows for:

    * 69 years of ids (the same as snowflakes)
    * at most 16 unique id generating workers
    * each worker can produce at most 256 ids per millisecond
    * so at most 4 million ids per second

If you're building a system in the sweet spot of not being too popular that
usage will grow to creating more than 4 million new things a second but you
could benefit from uncoordinated incrementing id generation and don't want to
punch yourself in the face every time you request data over a websocket from
JavaScript, this scheme might be a useful alternative.

.. code:: python

    >>> import fity3
    >>> f3 = fity3.generator(1)
    >>> next(f3)
    14127739136
    >>> next(f3)
    14132125952
    >>> next(f3)
    14135079168

    # convenience to convert to a unix timestamp
    >>> fity3.to_timestamp(14135079168)
    1413374250

Let's just hope we won't be the ones supporting any of these systems in 2079.
